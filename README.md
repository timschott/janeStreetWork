# janeStreetWork

Work completed for a Jane Street interview. They told me to use excel VBAs / macros but I hedged my bets and used R instead since I am much better with R than Excel. And it worked out well, I completed the task correctly within the allotted period of time!. 

**"SEC (Reg SHO Rule 200) requires all sell orders need to be marked either as “sell long”, or “sell short”[1].  An order is considered a short sale if you are selling stock that you do not own.  
For example, if the seller owned 200 shares of a security and wanted to sell 200 shares, he would mark the order “sell long”, and his inventory would decrease to 0.  If, however, he wanted to sell 300 shares (more shares than he owned), he would have to mark the order “sell short” and his inventory would decrease to -100.
The attached spreadsheet contains a number of executions in the security ABC US.  Assume account 10047745 did not own the security ABC US before today.  The executions have been marked based on the rule above, but there are some order marking mistakes.  Using Excel formulas and/or VBA macros, find and identify the order marking mistakes.  Please make sure you show your work in the spreadsheet."**
